Rock Middlewares
=======================

Middlewares allow non component code to interact with the redux store. They are great for handling logging, event analytics, exterior actions, and anything that interacts with store data but not with UI rendering directly. They make for great separation of concerns and can make an application much eaiser to debug and much more reliable.
